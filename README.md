# SemanticProjectionMetaphor
This repository contains the code for my work on semantic projection and metaphor. The idea is to use semantic projection (Grand et al., 2022) to see if the structure of word embedding spaces encodes metaphoric relationships between words from the source and target domains of conventional metaphors. In the google colab notebook (UpIsDownProjections.ipynb), I test this using the metaphoric mapping of GOOD IS UP, BAD IS DOWN. 
The pdf file (CLLancaster2023.pdf) contains the slides for a presentation on this topic, given at Corpus Linguistics 2023 at Lancaster University.
