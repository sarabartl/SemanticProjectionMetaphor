# SemanticProjectionMetaphor
This repository contains the code for my current PhD work on semantic projection and metaphor. The idea is to use semantic projection (Grand et al., 2022) to see if the structure of word embedding spaces encodes metaphoric relationships between domains. In the google colab notebook, I test this using the metaphor mapping of GOOD IS UP, BAD IS DOWN.
